# Travel Planner Project

## Introduction

This is a Travel Planner project built with React. It is designed to help users organize trip planning among friends, including voting on events, booking flights, and hotels.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/travelPlannerFrThisTime.git
cd travelPlannerFrThisTime
```

## Install Dependencies

Once you're cd in the project, run

```bash
npm install
```
let it run for a bit and once its done do

```bash
npm install slick-carousel react-slick
```
```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```
these are the ui things we're using. If you want to add more dependencies lmk.

You can start the project with 
```bash
npm start
```
everything should be working correctly, if it doesnt then lmk

## CONTRIBUTING

Once everything is set up and the dev server is working for you, you can start making changes by creating a separate branch in github, name it accordingly, and then navigating to that branch within your vscode.

This command navigates to the newly created branch:
```bash
git checkout name-of-ur-branch
```
on the bottom left of ur vscode you should see your branch name if you've correctly navigated to it, you can also confirm by doing 
```bash
git branch
```
the asterisk indicates which branch youre on.
When you're in the new branch, vscode has a git control button on the left sidebar, once you're ready to commit changes, the commit button will be enabled and you can commit ur stuff.
To commit you need to 'stage' your changes, if it asks you to stage just press yes, and itll commit for you. Also make sure to put a commit message at the top of the blue commit button, it wont let you commit unless you put something in so make sure to put something meaningful so i know whats happening.

###merge request
Once you're satisfied with your commits and you think that ur done, go to github and create a merge request for the main branch so i can look over and resolve conflicts, and then we can go from there.
